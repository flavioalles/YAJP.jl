Type that represents an individual task execution. What follows below is a list describing what each field stands for.
    * `kind`: string that identifies the task type. `type` would be a better name for this field but it is a [reserved word](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/types/#composite-types) in Julia.
    * `began`: marks at what point - relative to the beginning of the execution - the task began to execute.
    * `ended`: marks at what point - relative to the beginning of the execution - the task ended execution.

Obs: `Tasq` and not `Task` because `Task` is a [reserved word](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/control-flow/#man-tasks) in Julia.

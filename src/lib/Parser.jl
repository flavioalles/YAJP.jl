module Parser

using Constants, Data

"""
Acquires desired `StarPU` information from csv dump of Paj√© trace.

The expected argument is a path to the csv that will be parsed. No checking is done to insure existence and/or readability of file - `SystemError` is thrown and propagated (i.e. not caught here) in case the file cannot be opened.

The function returns an object of type `Trace` (exported by the `Data` module).
